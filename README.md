# 🎮 Connect Four (Python Console Game)

A simple yet fun **console-based implementation** of the classic *Connect Four* game written in **Python**.  
Two players take turns dropping pieces into a 7×6 grid — the first to connect four discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins!

## 🕹️ How to Play
- The game starts with an empty 7×6 grid.
- Players alternate turns entering a column number (1-7).
- The piece “drops” to the lowest available cell in that column.
- The first player to align four of their tokens (X or V) in a row wins.
- If the board fills completely without a winner, it’s a draw.
